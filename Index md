Overview

Dune's Query Engines¶

Dune currently supports three different query engines:

DuneSQL
SparkSQL
PostgreSQL
The SparkSQL and PostgreSQL query engines are being deprecated and will be replaced by DuneSQL. You can read more about the decisions to sunset the old query engines in the announcement post.

Sunsetting Schedule¶

We are progressively disabling the ability to create new queries on the old query engines. You can read up on the stages of that in the table below. The final date of the sunsetting will be 30/07/2023 when the old query engines will no longer receive new data and all executions will stop.

SparkSQL¶

Date	11/4/2023	30/05/2023	15/07/2023	30/07/2023
SparkSQL	Sunsetting Kickoff	no action taken	Query creation, edits disabled	End of Service
PostgreSQL¶

Date	11/4/2023	30/05/2023	15/07/2023	30/07/2023
PostgreSQL	Sunsetting Kickoff	Query creation disabled	edits disabled	End of Service
What this means for you¶

You will need to migrate your queries from SparkSQL or PostgreSQL to DuneSQL. If you don't migrate your queries, you queries will cease to update on 30/07/2023 and you will no longer be able to edit or execute them without migrating them to DuneSQL.

Migrating your queries¶

If you are using SparkSQL or PostgreSQL, you will need to migrate your queries to DuneSQL by 30/07/2023.

To migrate your queries from SparkSQL or PostgreSQL to DuneSQL, you can use the DuneSQL migration tool.
This tool will automatically convert your queries to DuneSQL. You can read about the Syntax differences between the engines in the respective sections of SparkSQL and PostgreSQL.

What happens to non-migrated queries?¶

After 30/07/2023, queries running on either SparkSQL or PostgreSQL will no longer be updated. You will still be able to access the data from your queries, but there won't be any new data added to your query results and they will stop executing. Query code will still be available to you, but you will not be able to edit it.

FAQ¶

general¶

What is DuneSQL?
Why another query engine?
DuneSQL was created to address the limitations of the old query engines, such as performance and scalability issues, as well as to provide a more modern and flexible solution. DuneSQL gives Dune full control over storage, execution, and query planning, which allows us to provide a faster, more reliable, and more scalable service.

What are the main differences between DuneSQL and the old query engines?
Some of the main differences between DuneSQL and the old query engines are:

DuneSQL is designed for scalability, whereas the old query engines have struggled with scaling issues in the past.
with DuneSQL, we control the entire stack, from the database to the query engine, which allows us to provide a more stable and reliable service.
DuneSQL has a simplified syntax that makes it easier to write and read queries.
Why a fork of Trino?
DuneSQL is a fork of Trino (formerly known as PrestoSQL) that has been customized to meet the specific needs of Dune. Trino is a powerful distributed SQL query engine that is widely used in the industry, and by forking it, Dune was able to leverage its proven technology while also adding its own unique features and improvements.

What happens to the existing queries that I have already migrated?
If you have already migrated your queries to DuneSQL, they will continue to work as before and you won't need to take any additional action.

Will Postgres and SparkSQL still be around for a while?
PostgreSQL and SparkSQL are being deprecated and will be replaced by DuneSQL. After 30/07/2023, queries running on either SparkSQL or PostgreSQL will no longer be updated. You will still be able to access the last execution result from your queries, but there won't be any new data added to your query results and they will stop executing. The Query code will still be available to you, but you will not be able to edit it.

What happens with Spellbook? Can I still contribute?
Spellbook is still a valuable tool for Dune and will continue to be used. You can still contribute to Spellbook by submitting pull requests on the project's GitHub repository. We are working on migrating Spellbook to DuneSQL. The Spellbook code will be migrated to DuneSQL by the Dune Team. The migration to DuneSQL has started and there now is 2 spellbook repos.

Timeline¶

When do Spark Queries stop working?
SparkSQL queries will stop being updated on 30/07/2023. This means they will no longer receive new data and will stop executing.

When do Postgres Queries stop working?
PostgreSQL queries will stop being updated on 30/07/2023. This means they will no longer receive new data and will stop executing.

Migration¶

How can I migrate existing Queries?
To migrate your queries from SparkSQL or PostgreSQL to DuneSQL, you can use the DuneSQL migration tool. This tool will automatically convert your queries to DuneSQL. Additionally, you can read about the Syntax differences between the engines in the respective sections of (SparkSQL)[sparksql.md] and (PostgreSQL)[postgresql.md].
